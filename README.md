# SCoTTi
SCoTTi (Semantic Clustering of Twitter-Tags over Time) is a fork of SCoT and a web application to view the topics of a hashtag and their evolvement over time. The idea is to help anyone interested in diachronic semantics visualize and compare the meanings a hashtag at different points in time. SCoTTi differs from SCoT in various ways. Most notably the semantic metrics of the Tweets are calculated with a different backend-technology (Scot uses JoBim, Scotti uses Embeddings with optimized settings for tweets). Further, the time-slices are different. Hashtag-semantics change much more quickly than news or books which are main domain for SCoT.
